# music-signaling
Python prototype of the music signaling pipeline

# Minor Improvements
1. Bit of popping on tail end of level 1 classical music (time stretching)
2. Make sure we pick up rhythmic element instead of harmonic in blues overlay
3. More careful jump rules on jumping for pop


# Major Developments:
1. Network Socket for Realtime Demos / API Plugins
2. Automatic sorting of track
3. Minimum latency enforcement (what should happen if signals are sent too fast)
