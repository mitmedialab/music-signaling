# music-signaling
Python prototype of the music signaling pipeline

# Minor Improvements
1. Bit of popping on tail end of level 1 classical music (time stretching)
2. Make sure we pick up rhythmic element instead of harmonic in blues overlay
3. More careful jump rules on jumping for pop
4. Classical needs fine tuning -- echo and stretch offset parameters


# Major Developments:
1. Automatic sorting of track
2. Minimum latency enforcement (what should happen if signals are sent too fast)
3. Add more control options to client interface
